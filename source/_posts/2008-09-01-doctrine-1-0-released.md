Today I am extremely happy to introduce the first stable version of
Doctrine, 1.0.0. If you've been around for a while, then you know this
is a long time coming. We've been hard at work on Doctrine for nearly 3
years and it is finally time to release a version we will support with
bug fix releases every month. This 1.0 release will be maintained until
March 1st 2010. Now we have 1.0, what is next? Below are some highlights
of what to expect in the future of Doctrine.

</p><ul><li>

Doctrine 2.0 - We've been working in trunk on Doctrine 2.0 for quite
sometime now and this is the next really big milestone for the project.
As we work on 2.0 we will backport things for intermediate major
versions(1.1, 1.2, etc.)

</li><li>

The Doctrine Company? - We'll be working on a new side to the Doctrine
project for organizing commercial support contracts, trainings,
seminars, certifications, training material and much more.

</li><li>

Doctrine supported by symfony 1.2 - We will be contributing to the
integration process of Doctrine with sfDoctrinePlugin. 1.2 will be the
first symfony release to bundle Doctrine and support it.

</li><li>

More and Better Documentation - Expect updated documentation as well as
some new pieces introduced. Doctrine Book?
