Today I am happy to bring you the second beta of the latest Doctrine 1.2
version. This is a solid bug fix release and we're getting very close to
a stable 1.2 version of Doctrine! It is recommended that you upgrade and
[report](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira) any issues in
[Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira) to help us test for
regressions between 1.1 and 1.2.

Take a look at the
[changelog](http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_BETA2) and
try it out by [downloading](http://www.doctrine-project.org) it.
