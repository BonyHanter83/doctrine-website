We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM [2.6.0](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/releases/tag/v2.6.0).

ORM 2.6.0
=========

This release contains almost 3 years of active development and it
provides several improvements and fixes, including:

-   Better commit order calculation
-   More stable second level cache
-   Strict testing and quality control
-   PHP 7.1+ requirement

[changelog](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/releases/tag/v2.6.0).

Next?
=====

This release marks the feature freeze of the 2.x version.

If you need to improve please work on the develop branch that will
become the 3.0 branch in the coming days. The changes are already too
numerous to easily rebase a feature from the 2.x branch to the develop
one.
