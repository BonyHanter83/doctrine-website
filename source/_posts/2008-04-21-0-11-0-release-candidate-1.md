<p>

Today I am happy to announce the first release candidate for the next
major version of Doctrine, 0.11. The 0.11 version of Doctrine brings
over 50 addressed tickets, a few new features, a few performance
improvements and lots of updates to the documentation/manual.

Here are the highlights:

</p><p>

-   \*Table.php classes are no longer generated by default when
    generating models from an existing database schema. This also means
    that ATTR\_AUTOLOAD\_TABLE\_CLASSES now defaults to FALSE

</p><p>

> -   Fixed some serious hydration bugs.

</p><p>

> -   Improved the hydration performance for large (joined) result sets.

</p><p>

> -   Application-level cascading deletes are back.

</p><p>

> We encourage everyone to test this release candidate thoroughly.
> Please report any issues through trac.
