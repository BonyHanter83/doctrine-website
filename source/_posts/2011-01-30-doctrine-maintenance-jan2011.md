We released the first maintenance versions of Common, DBAL and ORM
today. See the changelogs for more information:

-   [ORM, 26 Bugs
    fixed](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10114)
-   [DBAL, 1 Bug
    fixed](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10115)
-   Common, no known bugs

We also optimized the build process, so that the Version Classes in the
Git Tags do not contain the "-DEV" suffix anymore.

You can get the code from [Git](http://github.com/doctrine) , [our PEAR
channel](http://pear.doctrine-project.org) or from the [download
section](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects) of the website.
