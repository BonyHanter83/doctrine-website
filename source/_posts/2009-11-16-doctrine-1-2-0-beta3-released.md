We're getting very close to a stable Doctrine 1.2 with the latest BETA3
being released today. This will most likely be the last beta release
before our first release candidate next week. If everything goes as
planned we will have a stable release hopefully a little before the end
of November.

You can view the [change
log](http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_BETA3) or

now. If you find any issues please open tickets in
[Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
