Today we would like to announce the 0.10.4 release. This release
addresses 46 tickets and is a major step in stabilizing the 1st
generation of Doctrine for the 1.0 release. We will continue with bug
fix only releases until we feel the 0.10 branch is ready for a 1.0
title. Give it a try and give us some tickets and failing test cases to
fix :)

You can checkout the change log for the 0.10.4 release as well as
previous releases here.
