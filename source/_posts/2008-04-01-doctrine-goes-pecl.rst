After many long debates and countless hours of development,
Doctrine has been successfully ported to a PECL extension and will
be maintained as a PECL extension from now on. The extension can be
downloaded and installed via PEAR. As a PECL extension the ORM
performs 4 times as fast and brings unbelievable results. Enjoy!
