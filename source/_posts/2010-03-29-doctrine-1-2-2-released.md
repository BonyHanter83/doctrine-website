Today I am happy to bring you the second maintenance release for the 1.2
version of Doctrine. This release contains around 100 fixed issues from
[Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DC/fixforversion/10047).
We will continue regularly creating maintenance releases for the
Doctrine 1.2 version so if you have any problems, please create a issue
on Jira, include a patch with tests and we'll try and include it in the
next version.

As always you can find information about this new version on the
[download](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download) page.
