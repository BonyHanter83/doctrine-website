Recently we have done some work to sort out our domain names and the
permanent URL structure we will use from now on. We have put rules in
place to maintain all existing URLs so they redirect to
www.phpdoctrine.org, trac.phpdoctrine.org and svn.phpdoctrine.org. You
will need to update your svn externals to point to svn.phpdoctrine.org.
