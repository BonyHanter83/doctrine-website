RC2 of Doctrine 2.1 is packaged and can be grabbed from
[PEAR](http://pear.doctrine-project.org) and the download section.

We fixed several inconsistencies, backwards compatibility breaks and
some bugs.

Please test this release as it will probably be the base of the final
release due to be released later this week. The scheduled date is
Thursday 30th, but due to personal timetable this may become the
weekend.
