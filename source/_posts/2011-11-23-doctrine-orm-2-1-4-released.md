I just released Doctrine ORM 2.1.4. The Doctrine ORM 2.1.3 release has a
regression in the EntityManager\#merge() method, which is fixed in this
release. See the
[changelog](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10165).

Get the package from [PEAR](http://pear.doctrine-project.org) ,
[Downloads](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects) or from
[Github](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2).
