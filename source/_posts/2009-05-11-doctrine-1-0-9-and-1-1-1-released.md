Today I am very happy to make available two new releases of Doctrine for
the 1.0 and 1.1 code bases. These are both significant bug fix releases
and it is recommended that you upgrade right away.

-   [1.1.1](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download/1_1_1/format/tgz)
-   [1.0.9](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download/1_0_9/format/tgz)

You can find more information about these releases as usual on the
[download](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download) page.
