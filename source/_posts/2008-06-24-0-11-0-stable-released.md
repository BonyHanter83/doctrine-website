Today, I would like to introduce the latest stable version of Doctrine,
0.11.0. This release is a major release but it contains bug fixes only.
It contains a few BC enhancements that were required in order to fix
some bugs. We recommend everyone upgrade to 0.11. Below are some
highlights of this release.

</p><ul><li>

131 Tickets Closed

[4433] Introduced preDql\*() Hooks

</li><li>

Introduced SoftDelete Behavior

</li><li>

Introduced Application Level Cascading Deletes

</li><li>

Many fixes to Behavior system, primarily Nesting Behaviors.

</li></ul>  <p>

Another item worth mentioning about the 0.11 release is that the
integration between Doctrine and symfony has evolved quite well over the
first quarter of 2008 as symfony 1.1 is coming out and 0.11 is released.
The integration between symfony 1.1 and Doctrine with sfDoctrinePlugin
is now officially supported by the symfony core team and we will slowly
be introducing more documentation over the coming months.
