Right out of the gate we're moving extremely fast. Only two days in to
working full-time on the project we've made some significant pushes
forward. On Monday we made available the first 1.0 Release Candidate and
then immediately began working on the second and final release
candidate. This milestone is extremely significant as it already
contains over 70 closed tickets! It will be released either Wednesday or
Thursday and 1.0 Stable will follow after it on Monday September 1st.
Below are some other highlights on the progress made so far.
