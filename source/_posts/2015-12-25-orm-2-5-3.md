We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM
[2.5.3](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/releases/tag/v2.5.3).

Dependency constraints on the
[doctrine/common](https://github.com/doctrine/common) component
supported versions were corrected, allowing users to install
`doctrine/common` version `2.6.*` together with the ORM. This also means
that PHP 7 scalar type-hints and return type declarations are now
reflected in the generated proxy classes.
[\#4884](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/4884)

Merging versioned entities caused the merged instance to have a `null`
version: this is now fixed.
[\#1573](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/1573)

It was impossible to use interface names when referencing entity types
in DQL: it is now possible to do so when using the
[ResolveTargetEntityListener](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/v2.5.3/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Tools/ResolveTargetEntityListener.php).
