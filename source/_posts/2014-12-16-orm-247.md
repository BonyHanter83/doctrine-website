We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM
2.4.7.

The release includes a fix for `null` values in column mapping options
support:
[DDC-3425](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3425) We also
fixed various `Paginator` tool issues: - allowing DQL queries that have
`HIDDEN` selected fields appearing both in the `SELECT` and the
`ORDER BY` clauses:
[DDC-3434](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3434) -
allowing DQL queries that have `SELECT` clauses containing parameters:
[DDC-3336](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3336)
