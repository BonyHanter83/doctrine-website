We have released the first mini release in the 2.3 cycle. Due to high
workload of all the participating developers we couldn't release this
earlier. We hope to release 2.3.2 in a much shorter period from now.

-   [DBAL
    Changelog](http://doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10325)
-   [ORM
    Changelog](http://doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10323)

You can install the release through
[Github](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2) , download, PEAR or
[Composer](http://www.packagist.org):

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "2.3.1"
        }
    }
