A little late, but the third release candidate of the 0.11.0
version of Doctrine has been released. This will be the last
scheduled release candidate before 0.11 becomes the latest stable
version of Doctrine. This release contains dozens of bug fixes and
a few small enhancements. The change log can be read here.
