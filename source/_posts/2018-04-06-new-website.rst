In 2007 Doctrine got its first official website at `phpdoctrine.org <https://www.phpdoctrine.org/>`_.
Before that, the website was an instance of `Trac <https://trac.edgewall.org/>`_ which
also served as our documentation, issue tracker and project management tool.

The new website design was created by `Phu Son Nguyen <https://phuson.com/>`_ who
worked at Yahoo! at the time. It was a huge step forward for the Doctrine Project
and it gave us 10 solid years!

Fast-forward and today we are happy to be launching a new foundation for our website
and documentation. In addition to the new look, here are some new features:

- GitHub Edit links on all documentation pages to make it easy to contribute fixes when you come across something that could be improved.
- Automated deploys with GitHub Pages. Simply create a pull request and it will be deployed to `https://staging.doctrine-project.org <https://staging.doctrine-project.org>`_. Merges to master automatically deploy to `https://www.doctrine-project.org <https://www.doctrine-project.org>`_.
- Search powered by `Algolia <https://www.algolia.com/>`_.
- Mobile friendly.
- Documentation supports multiple versions.
- Documentation user experience improvements.
- HTTPS

We hope that this helps improve the experience and make it easier to contribute. The code
for the site is open source and can be found `here <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine-website/>`_.
If you want to contribute to the documentation for a project, you can find the docs in a folder named
``/docs`` in the root of the project repository. `Here <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/tree/master/docs>`_ is the ORM for example.

If you discover any issues, please report them on the `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine-website/issues>`_ tracker for the project.
