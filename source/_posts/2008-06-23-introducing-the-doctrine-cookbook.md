Today I would like to introduce something new to the Doctrine
documentation, the Cookbook. This differs from the manual in that it
will contain real world examples and tutorials of how you can use
Doctrine on a daily basis whereas the manual is more of a technical
breakdown of the features in Doctrine. We will be publishing many
additions to the cookbook in the coming weeks. To start off we have
published the following tutorials:

My First Project

</li><li>

symfony 1.1 and Doctrine

</li><li>

symfony 1.1 and Doctrine Migrations

</li><li>

Code Igniter and Doctrine

</li></ul><p> 

If you are interested in contributing to the Doctrine documentation by
adding new things or translations please contact me at
[jonwage@gmail.com](mailto:jonwage@gmail.com).
