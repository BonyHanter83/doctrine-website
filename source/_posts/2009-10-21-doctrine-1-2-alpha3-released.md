Today I am happy to bring you hopefully the last alpha release for
Doctrine 1.2. We decided to have one more alpha due to some interesting
issues and improvements brought to our attention related to PEAR
model/file naming standards, result set caching improvements and a few
other things. You can of course check out what all is new in Doctrine in
the [upgrade](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2) file. Below
are some quick links to some of the most recent changes.

-   [PEAR Style Model Loading and
    Generation](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2#PEAR%20Style%20Model%20Loading%20and%20Generation)
-   [Ordering
    Relationships](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2#Ordering%20Relationships)
-   [Result Cache
    Improvements](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2#Result%20Cache%20Improvements)

Go ahead and [download](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download)
Doctrine 1.2 ALPHA3 and give it a try. Let us know if you have any
issues by raising a new issue in
[JIRA](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
