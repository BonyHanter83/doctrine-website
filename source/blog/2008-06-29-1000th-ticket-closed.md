Tonight I have closed the 1000th ticket in the Doctrine Trac. This is a
big milestone for Doctrine and it has taken the work of many people to
reach this. Thanks to all the users who took the time to report issues
to us (test case or not ;) ), it is much appreciated and Doctrine would
not be able to move forward without it.
