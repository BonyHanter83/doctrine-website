1.1 Release Manager
===================

First, I would like to introduce **Guilherme Blanco** as the release
manager of **Doctrine 1.1**. This means he will be responsible for
organizing the tickets and managing the releases for the 1.1 branch from
now on. So, if you have any issues you can yell at him :)

1.1 Release Candidate
=====================

Another great thing today is that we have made available the first
release candidate of the 1.1 branch. We were originally planning on
having a third beta but as the amount of tickets that came in was
practically none, we decided to move on to the release candidate stage.

As always, you can [download
here](https://www.doctrine-project.org/download) and check out the
[change log](https://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_0_RC1) and
the [upgrade](https://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_1) document to
find out what has changed in 1.1.
