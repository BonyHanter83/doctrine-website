We are happy to announce the immediate availability of
`doctrine/annotations` 1.2.3.

The release includes fixes for regressions that were introduced by some
bug-fixes in version 1.2.2:

-   [49: \#46 - applying correct chmod() to generated cache
    file](https://github.com/doctrine/annotations/pull/49)
-   [50: Hotfix: match escaped quotes (revert
    \#44)](https://github.com/doctrine/annotations/pull/50)

You can install the Annotations library using Composer and the following
`composer.json` contents:

{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/annotations": "1.2.3"
    }
}
~~~~
