Today I have published another tutorial in the 1.0 Cookbook. This recipe
solves the same situation where you want to allow address properties on
multiple records. This approach is a much more normalized implementation
compared to using templates/behaviors and it allows for multiple
addresses instead of only one. Check it out in the cookbook here. Enjoy!
