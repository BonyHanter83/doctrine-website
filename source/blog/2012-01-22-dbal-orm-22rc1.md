Again with a slight delay we finalized the DBAL and ORM release
candidates for the 2.2 branch. There have been some late changes that
made the delay necessary:

-   DBAL Schema supported was heavily refactored to include the concept
    of "namespaces". This abstracts multi-database useage for MySQL and
    Schema support for PostgreSQL.
-   A Paginator was put into the DoctrineORMToolsPagination namespace.
    Its the combination of the original DoctrineExtensions Paginator
    with extensions done in the KnpLabs components and the Pagerfanta
    library.

As usual you can grab the code from:

-   [Packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/)
-   [PEAR](http://pear.doctrine-project.org)
-   [Downloads](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects)
-   [Github](http://github.com/doctrine)

Please test this code with your applications. If no bugs or
backwards-compatible breaks are reported in the next days we will
release the final version on friday.
