In our quest to make Doctrine financially sustainable, we have created
Doctrine Company, LLC for the team to do business under. We've had a strong
10 years of open source success but we believe that in order for Doctrine to be
truly sustainable and to last another decade, we need to diversify and monetize
the project. It is our goal to be able to generate enough money through the project
to fund full or part time work on the project. Below you will find details of some
of our monetization efforts.

## Patreon

Patreon is a platform that allows open-source maintainers, artists, creators, etc. to create
relationships with their users and offer them benefits for becoming a Patreon.

If you would like to make a donation to the project, Patreon is the place to do it.
Depending on the tier, we offer a few different benefits:

- A mention on Twitter.
- Your name and website link on the Doctrine website.
- Priority responses to Stackoverflow or GitHub Issues/Pull Requests.
- Placement on a Partners page on the Doctrine website, with your logo, link and a description advertising your company's services.

## Consulting

Under the Doctrine Company, we are providing [Consulting and Training](/consulting.html)
services to companies that use PHP. The services we offer are not limited to Doctrine itself.
Our team specializes in writing high quality PHP. Whether you are starting a new project or
modernizing a legacy application, we can help your team level up their skills with tools
like the following:

- [Doctrine DBAL](/projects/dbal.html) - Connect to your favorite RDBMS using the Doctrine DBAL.
- [Doctrine Database Migrations](/projects/migrations.html) - Manage and keep your database schema up to date safely with Doctrine Migrations.
- [Doctrine ORM](/projects/orm.html) - Represent your domain model cleanly with plain old PHP objects and ensure the integrity of your data.
- [Doctrine Coding Standard](/projects/coding-standard.html) - Never again debate about code aesthetics in pull request reviews. Implement the Doctrine Coding Standard and the rules will be enforced in your build process.
- [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) / [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) - Statically analyze your codebase and find bugs that would otherwise only be found at runtime in production.

If you are interested, take a look at our [Consulting](/consulting.html) page and contact
us at [consulting@doctrine-project.org](mailto:consulting@doctrine-project.org) for more
information.

## Events

We will host regular monthly webinars using Zoom. Each month we will have different topics
presented to you by Doctrine Core team members and members of the community. We already have
some great topics lined up for the next few months:

- [Doctrine for Beginners on June 25th 2019](/events/2/doctrine-for-beginners.html)
- [Getting started with Doctrine MongoDB ODM on July 16th 2019](/events/3/getting-started-with-doctrine-mongodb-odm.html)
- [PHP Internals for the Inquisitive Developer on September 10th 2019](/events/1/php-internals-for-the-inquisitive-developer.html)

## Tidelift

[Tidelift](https://tidelift.com) is a managed open source subscription service backed by
creators and maintainers. Development teams get better maintained open source. Maintainers
get paid.

We have partnered with Tidelift as a maintainer to guarantee a high level of maintenance for their
customers. In return, Tidelift pays Doctrine maintainers a percentage of what the customer pays.
Tidelift is attempting to create a marketplace of open-source maintainers and customers with the
goal of providing higher levels of confidence for commercial entities when using open-source. This
can sometimes be one of the biggest challenges for using open-source in the corporate world.
Tidelift is taking a unique approach to solving this problem and we are excited to be a part of it!

## Carbon Ads

One of the most valuable assets we have besides software is our website and the traffic we
receive every month. You may have noticed some subtle ad placements on our website. These ads
are provided by [Carbon Ads](https://www.carbonads.net/) which is an ad network optimized
for reaching designers and developers. We understand ads can be annoying and we hope that
our users understand the tradeoff we've made by choosing to place ads on our website.

## Partners

Finally, we are partnering with commercial entities and other projects that use Doctrine to cross
promote each other. Through our partner network we will introduce our users to services and
offerings that they can benefit from. Thanks to our [Partners](/partners.html) for supporting
Doctrine.
