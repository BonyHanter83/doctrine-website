On Friday November 30th, the second beta release of the PHP5 Doctrine
ORM software was released. A lot of progress has been made since the
first beta(formerly known as RC1). Dozens and dozens of tickets have
been fixed, new features have been added, much needed re-factorings have
taken place and the community behind Doctrine is growing daily.
