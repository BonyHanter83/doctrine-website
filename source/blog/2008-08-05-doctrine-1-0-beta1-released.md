<p>

Today I am happy to announce the release of Doctrine 1.0-BETA1. This
marks the true start for the 1st generation Doctrine stable lifecycle.
As you may already know, Doctrine 1.0 has been slated to be released on
September 1st 2008 for quite some time now. We still have a few more
pre-1.0 releases to go until 1.0. The roadmap for now is BETA1, RC1, RC2
and then 1.0 STABLE. You can see the roadmap in trac if you're
interested in keeping up with the Doctrine schedule. More information on
1.0 and what other things to expect on September 1st will be given soon.
Make some noise!
