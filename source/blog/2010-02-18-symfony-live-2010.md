This past week I had the pleasure of spending time in Paris, France for
the [2010 Symfony Live](http://www.symfony-live.com) conference. My
first Symfony event was [Symfony Camp](http://www.symfonycamp.com) in
2008 which was a great success. I also attended the first Symfony Live
last year where I spoke about [Sympal](http://www.sympalphp.org) and
Doctrine. This time around the Symfony conference was an even bigger
success! The community around Symfony and Doctrine has grown a great
amount over the years and the event shows that! Many great speakers and
topics were present at the conference and it was very exciting to get to
be a part of it.

On the first day of the conference I was invited to speak about the
latest Doctrine 2! This is perfect timing as Fabien Potencier made
available the source code of [Symfony
2](http://www.symfony-reloaded.org) the following day. I am very excited
about what the future holds for PHP in the coming years as Symfony 2 and
Doctrine 2 are really revolutionary PHP projects!

You can find the presentations given at the conference related to
Doctrine below:

    Migrations](http://www.slideshare.net/denderello/symfony-live-2010-using-doctrine-migrations)

    ORM](http://www.slideshare.net/jwage/doctrine-2-not-the-same-old-php-orm)
