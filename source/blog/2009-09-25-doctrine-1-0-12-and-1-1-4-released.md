Today I am happy to bring you two new maintenance releases for the 1.0
and 1.1 versions of Doctrine. These are both standard maintenance
releases and only contain bug fixes.

> **NOTE** **1.1 End of Life**
>
> This is the second to last maintenance release for the 1.1 version and
> we are still scheduled to hit the end of life on **November 1, 2009**.
> The good news is 1.2 will be a **LTS(long term support)** release and
> will have **18** months of support from the date it is released.

You can view the change logs and download these releases on the
[download](http://www.doctrine-project.org) page.
