<p>

Starting in September 2008, I will begin working full-time on Doctrine!
This great opportunity has been allowed by Sensio, the creators of the
symfony MVC Framework. This arrangement will allow many great new things
to happen for Doctrine. Below you will find a list of some of the things
you can look forward to:

</p>  <ul><li>

Core Development

</li><li>

The Doctrine Book

</li><li>

Travel to conferences

</li><li>

Doctrine Evangelism

</li><li>

Commercial/Paid Support

</li><li>

Workshops

</li><li>

Certifications

</li></ul>  <p>

This is also good news for the symfony project as it is due to
officially support Doctrine as its primary ORM in future versions. I
will also be helping the core symfony team with the official integration
of Doctrine with sfDoctrinePlugin.
