Doctrine has been used by many symfony developers for nearly two years
as an externally maintained plugin. This week it became official and
Doctrine will be bundled and supported by the symfony core team as of
version 1.2 which is slated for late Q4 2008. You can read the full blog
article on the symfony-project.org blog.
