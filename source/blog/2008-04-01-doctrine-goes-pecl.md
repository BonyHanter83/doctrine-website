After many long debates and countless hours of development, Doctrine has
been successfully ported to a PECL extension and will be maintained as a
PECL extension from now on. The extension can be downloaded and
installed via PEAR. As a PECL extension the ORM performs 4 times as fast
and brings unbelievable results. Enjoy!
