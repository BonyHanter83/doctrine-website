Only a few hours ago we released the stable version of Doctrine 1.2! Now
we bring you two maintenance releases for the 1.0 and 1.1 versions of
Doctrine. The number of changes in these releases are small, but they
are important bug fixes. It is recommended that you upgrade. Download
[1.0.14](https://www.doctrine-project.org/download#1_0) and
[1.1.6](https://www.doctrine-project.org/download#1_1) now and report any
issues you discover in [Jira](https://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
