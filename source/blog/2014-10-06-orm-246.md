We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM
2.4.6.

We fixed a PHP 5.6 compatibility issue which prevented usage of entities
extending from internal PHP classes or implementing the `Serializable`
interface with the ORM:
[DDC-3120](https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/3897).

You can find all the changes on JIRA:

-   [ORM
    2.4.6](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10723)
    - 2 issues fixed

You can install the ORM using Composer and the following `composer.json`
contents:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .json}
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/orm": "2.4.6"
    }
}
~~~~

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
