In 2007 Doctrine got its first official website at
[phpdoctrine.org](https://www.phpdoctrine.org/). Before that, the
website was an instance of [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) which also
served as our documentation, issue tracker and project management tool.

The new website design was created by [Phu Son
Nguyen](https://phuson.com/) who worked at Yahoo! at the time. It was a
huge step forward for the Doctrine Project and it gave us 10 solid
years!

Fast-forward and today we are happy to be launching a new foundation for
our website and documentation. In addition to the new look, here are
some new features:

-   GitHub Edit links on all documentation pages to make it easy to
    contribute fixes when you come across something that could be
    improved.
-   Automated deploys with GitHub Pages. Simply create a pull request
    and it will be deployed to
    [https://staging.doctrine-project.org](https://staging.doctrine-project.org).
    Merges to master automatically deploy to
    [https://www.doctrine-project.org](https://www.doctrine-project.org).
-   Search powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).
-   Mobile friendly.
-   Documentation supports multiple versions.
-   Documentation user experience improvements.
-   HTTPS

We hope that this helps improve the experience and make it easier to
contribute. The code for the site is open source and can be found
[here](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine-website/). If you want to
contribute to the documentation for a project, you can find the docs in
a folder named `/docs` in the root of the project repository.
[Here](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/tree/master/docs) is the
ORM for example.

If you discover any issues, please report them on the [GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine-website/issues) tracker for
the project.
