Today I am very happy to introduce the first alpha version of the 1.1
branch of Doctrine. This means we have just about finalized the scope of
features and are preparing to enter the beta and release candidate
cycles before releasing the stable version.

This new version is sporting dozens of enhancements and even more bug
fixes. Primarily the [new scalar hydration
type](https://www.doctrine-project.org/2008/10/12/new-hydration-modes-for-doctrine-1-1.html)
, [the migration diff
tool](https://www.doctrine-project.org/2008/10/18/new-to-migrations-in-1-1.html) ,
and other [miscellaneous new
features](https://www.doctrine-project.org/2008/10/02/doctrine-1-1-development-begins.html).

You can download the package
[here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download) and read some
documentation on the changes and new features
[here](http://trac.doctrine-project.org/browser/branches/1.1/UPGRADE_TO_1_1).
