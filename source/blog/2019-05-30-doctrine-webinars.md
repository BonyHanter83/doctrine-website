As mentioned in the [Monetizing Open Source](/2019/05/21/monetizing-open-source.html) blog post,
Doctrine will be regularly organizing online [webinars](/events.html) hosted with [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
You can join from anywhere in the world with a laptop and an internet connection. We will
have topics presented by Doctrine core team members and members of the community.

To get things started we have a few webinars scheduled for the next few months:

- [Doctrine for Beginners](/events/2/doctrine-for-beginners.html) on June 25th by Jonathan Wage
- [Getting Started with Doctrine MongoDB ODM](/events/3/getting-started-with-doctrine-mongodb-odm.html) on July 16th by Andreas Braun
- [PHP Internals for the Inquisitive Developer](/events/1/php-internals-for-the-inquisitive-developer.html) on September 10th by Jeremy Mikola

Don't see something that you are interested in? [Suggest](https://www.doctrine-project.org/events/suggest.html) an event topic you would like to see and we will see what we can do. We will be publishing new events in the coming weeks so check back soon!
