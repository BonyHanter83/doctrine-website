A little late, but the third release candidate of the 0.11.0 version of
Doctrine has been released. This will be the last scheduled release
candidate before 0.11 becomes the latest stable version of Doctrine.
This release contains dozens of bug fixes and a few small enhancements.
The change log can be read here.
