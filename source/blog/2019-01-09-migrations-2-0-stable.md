Today I am very excited to announce the stable release of Doctrine Migrations 2.0.
Almost 10 years ago on Mar 23, 2010, the [first commit](https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/commit/8f198ef623051a5eeb21d93bfc7a8a49efbe9d63) of the 1.0 codebase was created.
The history of the Doctrine Migrations project actually even goes back further to the
days of Doctrine1 ORM but this was before the days of GitHub, Composer, etc and I think
some of that history has been lost. It is amazing to look back over the last decade at
how much the PHP eco-system has changed. It makes me appreciate all the great tools we
have, even with all their flaws.

## What is in 2.0?

The 2.0 release should be a relatively easy upgrade for most people. The primary goal of the
2.0 release was to modernize the codebase according to Doctrine Coding Standards, PHPStan and
all of the other standardized Doctrine project infrastructure that has evolved over the last
few years. This will ensure the project is alive and relevant for another decade.

This release contains **36** resolved issues with **71** pull requests coming from **18** different
contributors.
