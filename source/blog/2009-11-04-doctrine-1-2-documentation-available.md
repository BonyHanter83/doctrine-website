I am happy to announce that [Doctrine 1.2
documentation](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_2/en)
is now available and up to date. It might still need some work but for
the most part it is updated with all the new features and changes in
1.2.

New Chapters
============

-   [Data
    Hydrators](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_2/en/data-hydrators)
-   [Extensions](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_2/en/extensions)

Please read over it and create
[Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira) issues for any problems or
corrections you find.
