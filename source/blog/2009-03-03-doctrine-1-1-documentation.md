Today I have begun updating the documentation to reflect the changes
made in 1.1 and [The Guide to Doctrine for
PHP](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_1/en) is now
available. We still have some more changes to make but most things have
been updated and added.

Below is a list of some of the things that still need some updating.

-   Migrations
-   SoftDelete
-   Searchable

Please lend a hand to us by reviewing the documentation and helping us
identify things that are lacking or 100% missing. You can create new
tickets in [trac](http://trac.doctrine-project.org) under the
"Documentation/Website" milestone and we'll get them fixed asap.
