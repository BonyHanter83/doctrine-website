We have released version 2.3.4 of Doctrine ORM and DBAL. We fixed as
much as 18 DBAL tickets and 12 ORM tickets.

See a Changelog of both components:

-   [DBAL](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10421)
-   [ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10420)

You can install the release with
[PEAR](http://pear.doctrine-project.org) or with
[Composer](http://www.packagist.org):

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "2.3.4",
            "doctrine/dbal": "2.3.4"
        }
    }
