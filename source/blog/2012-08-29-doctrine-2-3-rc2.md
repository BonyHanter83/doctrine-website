**29.8.2012**

We released another release candidate of our upcoming Doctrine 2.3.0
version. This includes the Common, DBAL and ORM packages.

This release trys to keep backwards compatibility to every previous
release as much as possible, however some slight changes might be
necessary to your applications. See the UPGRADE files of each project
for details:

-   [ORM](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/UPGRADE.md)
-   [DBAL](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/UPGRADE)

See the [2.3 Beta blog
post](http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/doctrine-2-3-beta.html) for
some information about changes in 2.3.

You can install the release candidate through
[Github](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2) or
[Composer](http://www.packagist.org):

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "2.3.0-RC2"
        },
        "minimum-stability": "dev"
    }

If you find any problems with your applications please report them on
our [bugtracker](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).

When no blocking issues occur we will release the 2.3.0 final on next
Monday.
