As you probably already noticed, the Doctrine website looks a little bit
different. In preparation for the Doctrine 2.0 release, the website
needed to be improved a little bit to better handle the multiple
versions and projects under the Doctrine umbrella. Along the way I did a
little spring cleaning of some code from the early Doctrine days as
well!

You can now find dedicated sections of the website for both the Object
Relational Mapper and Database Abstraction Layer projects:

-   [ORM Project](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm)
-   [DBAL Project](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal)

The new website also introduces a new API Documentation thanks to [PHP
Doctor](http://peej.github.com/phpdoctor/)!

-   [Doctrine 2 ORM API
    Documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/2.0/api)
-   [Doctrine 2 DBAL API
    Documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal/2.0/api)

If you have any problems with the website please let me know by e-mail
at jonwage [at] gmail.com.
