<p>

Today we have a few updates for the project to announce. You can read
about whats new below.

</p><p>

Doctrine Release Candidate 1 Released

</p><p>

The first release candidate of Doctrine 1.0 has been made available.
Doctrine 1.0 is still scheduled to be released on September 1st 2008.
You can download Doctrine here.

New Domain! www.doctrine-project.org

</p><p>

We have decided to ditch the old phpdoctrine.org domain in favor of
doctrine-project.org. The main reason is due to licensing complications
and us not being technically allowed to have the name PHP in our project
name.

Minor Website Ideas

</p><p>

We have updated the website with some minor asthetic changes, primarily
to the homepage.
