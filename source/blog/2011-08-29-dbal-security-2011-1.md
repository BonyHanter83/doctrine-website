It was brought to our attention that identifier quoting in Doctrine DBAL
has a potential security problem when user-input is passed into this
function, making the security aspect of this functionality obsolete. We
fixed as soon as we realized it and apologize for to our users for this
error.

We released versions 2.1.2 and 2.0.8 of DBAL that both contain a fix for
the problem. You can grab the code from
[PEAR](http://pear.doctrine-project.org) ,
[Github](http://github.com/doctrine/dbal) or the [Downloads
section](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal/download).

If you make use of AbstractPlatform::quoteIdentifier() or
Doctrine::quoteIdentifier() please upgrade immediately. The ORM itself
does not use identifier quoting in combination with user-input, however
we still urge everyone to update to the latest version of DBAL.
