Now that the dust has settled from the move to git I suppose it is time
for a blog post. About a month ago, we made the decision to switch the
Doctrine projects source control to [git](https://git-scm.com). Like many
other [open source projects](http://www.symfony-project.org) , we also
chose [github.com](https://www.github.com) to host our repositories.
Github brings a whole new level of collaborative coding to the Doctrine
community and I can already see more people getting involved because of
it.

Still want to use SVN?
======================

If you still want to use subversion externals in your project, you can
do so by using the read-only SVN features of github.com:

-   Doctrine 1.2 -
    [http://svn.github.com/doctrine/doctrine1.git](http://svn.github.com/doctrine/doctrine1.git)
-   Doctrine 2.0 -
    [http://svn.github.com/doctrine/orm.git](http://svn.github.com/doctrine/orm.git)

You can read about this feature on the github
[blog](https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).

Need to learn git?
==================

Through the process of moving to git, we have all had to learn lots but
it could not have been done without the [Pro Git
Book](http://progit.org/). It is an awesome book written by [Scott
Chacon](http://twitter.com/CHACON) who works at github and is a git guru
among other things.. The book can be ordered or can be [read
online](http://progit.org/book/) for free!

Want to contribute to Doctrine?
===============================

If you are interested in contributing to the Doctrine project, you will
need to fork one of the Doctrine
[repositories](https://github.com/doctrine) and submit your
modifications. You can read more about how to ["Fork a project and
submit your
modifications"](https://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications/7)
on the github website.
