After a long wait, I am happy to bring you the second beta release of
the new Doctrine persistence layer for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).
This release includes dozens of bug fixes and improvements and it is
recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible. You can learn about
how to get the code here.

About the Release
=================

My full-time job is working at OpenSky, where we use the MongoDB ODM and
many of the improvements and work are a result of the development we've
been doing there. The changelog is very large as the development spanned
almost 5 months with commits from over 15 developers all over the world.
Here are some of the people who've contributed this release:

Documentation
=============

Check out the
[documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/mongodb_odm/1.0/en)
as it is has been completely updated and improved for this release. We
fully migrated the docs to use reST and Sphinx to generate our
documentation so it is much improved over the previous versions.

Doctrine Project as a Whole
===========================

The MongoDB ODM is one of a few new projects under the Doctrine
umbrella. You may also want to take a look at the CouchDB ODM and the
PHP Content Repository ODM. These projects are all very exciting for the
Doctrine Project but more for PHP as a whole. They are a new generation
of libraries built for PHP 5.3 that bring a higher level of code quality
to your PHP projects.

If you encounter any problems, bugs or issues please report them in
Jira. If you have any questions you can try a mailing list or IRC. Read
more about the Doctrine community here.
