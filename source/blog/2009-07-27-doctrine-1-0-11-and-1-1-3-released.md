Today I am happy to introduce two new maintenance releases for Doctrine,
1.0.11 and 1.1.3. As always these are regular maintenance releases and
contain dozens of bug fixes. Below you will find links to view the
changelogs for both releases.

-   [Doctrine 1.0.11
    Changelog](https://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_11)
-   [Doctrine 1.1.3
    Changelog](https://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_3)

It is recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible. You can download
the new versions from the
