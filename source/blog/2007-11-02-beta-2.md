The Doctrine team is proud to announce that we have scheduled the
release of the second beta snapshot for November 31st, 2007. This is
very exciting news for the Doctrine team and community.

This means Doctrine is nearing a real release candidate :) As you all
know, we had a RC1 that was released a little while back, but it was a
mistake to call it an RC since we planned on still making many changes
that would break BC. We have corrected ourselves and renamed it Beta1.
We will continue with beta releases until we are comfortable with
releasing a true RC1.
