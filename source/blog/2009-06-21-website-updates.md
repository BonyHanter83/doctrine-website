Today I have deployed some updates to the Doctrine website. Some of the
updates all of you will enjoy, but another specific one might upset some
of you.

I have decided to remove the Doctrine Forum forever and consolidate the
user discussions in to the
[doctrine-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/doctrine-user) mailing
list which is hosted on Google Groups. I chose to do this for a few
reasons.

-   Consolidate discussions in to one area so the community is not
    split.
-   phpBB is horrible and is proving to be a lot of work for me to
    maintain
-   I don't want to have to spend countless hours maintaining something
    that google groups can do for me, for free

I know this will upset some of you, but I hope you understand and are
happy that the Doctrine developers will now be able to spend more
time...**developing Doctrine**..instead of maintaining the forum.

Some other changes I have made/fixed.

-   Change Logs are now fixed from the move
-   The [blog](https://www.doctrine-project.org/blog) has been enhanced
    and tags fixed
-   [API
    Documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/Doctrine_Record/1_1)
    Enhanced to include browse code links so you can see the code for
    each class, function, etc.
-   A bunch of other small little things tweaked and fixed.

If you find anything wrong with the website or something you'd like to
see different please let me know via the comments below or by e-mail at
