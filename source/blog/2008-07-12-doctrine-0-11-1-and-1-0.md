<p>

Today we have released a new version, 0.11.1. As with all point releases
it is a bug fix only release. With over 81 tickets closed, this is
definetly a significant release for Doctrine towards 1.0. We recommend
that you upgrade.

We have also created the 1.0 branch and will begin actively working on
it. We have hit the final straight away towards 1.0! This was originally
slated to be the 0.12 branch but we feel it is ready and we will spend
the next 2 months furiously working on tickets before we release it on
September 1st. We will have some short intermediate BETA and RC releases
before then but these will primarily be bug fix releases only. Make some
hype please, thanks. ;)
