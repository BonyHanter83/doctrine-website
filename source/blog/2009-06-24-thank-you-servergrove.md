As you all may know, we recently
[moved](http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/doctrine-changing-homes)
the Doctrine infrastructure to a brand new home. This is all thanks to
[ServerGrove](http://www.servergrove.net/). I contacted them a few
months ago about potentially sponsoring us and they did not hesitate one
bit. They were more than willing to setup a dedicated community server
for us, free of charge. Within 48 hours of my e-mail I had a dedicated
server ready to go. I had the server for about a month before I was able
to make the move. They simply moved faster then I expected and have gone
above and beyond anything I could have imagined.

If you all need proper hosting support for your Symfony or Doctrine
projects, I would highly recommend them.
