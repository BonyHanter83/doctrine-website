Community
=========

The Doctrine community is made up of thousands of developers all around
the world. The project has had over 500 contributors and is maintained
by a core team of developers. If you want to get involved, find other
Doctrine developers on GitHub, the Mailing Lists and Gitter.

GitHub
------

Code contributions are coordinated via GitHub pull requests. Go [here],
find the project you want to contribute to and from there you will see a
link for Pull Requests. You can browse existing pull requests or create
one of your own.

Mailing Lists
-------------

The primary means for communication between Doctrine users and
developers is the mailing list hosted with Google Groups:

- [Doctrine User Mailing List]

Gitter Chat
-----------

If you prefer a more real time way of communicating with other Doctrine
developers you can use [Gitter].
