                        You've used Doctrine ORM but never used MongoDB? With MongoDB ODM you can use familiar
                        tools with a different kind of database. This webinar will focus on getting MongoDB
                        set up and designing our first documents for MongoDB. We'll cover differences in schema
                        design between relational databases and MongoDB and also use more advanced features like
                        aggregation pipelines and document validation.

                        Come to this talk prepared to learn about the Doctrine PHP open source project.
                        The Doctrine project has been around for over a decade and has evolved from database
                        abstraction software that dates back to the PEAR days. The packages provided by the
                        Doctrine project have been downloaded almost a billion times from packagist. In
                        this talk we will take you through how to get started with Doctrine and how to take
                        advantage of some of the more advanced features.

                        Even if you have no intention of becoming a PHP core developer or creating a PECL
                        extension, cursory knowledge of PHP's inner workings can prove useful. This session
                        will examine the lifecycle of a PHP request and equip you with essential knowledge
                        and tools that can be used to diagnose the occasional segfault or language bug,
                        decipher what a poorly documented SPL class actually does, and confidently answer why
                        a PHP or C implementation is most warranted for a given problem.
